## Bunches Technical Task
### TicTacToe

We have provided an implementation of a game of TicTacToe. 

Currently the game has quite a few bugs, for example it can't tell who has won. It also has no unit tests and no styling.

We would like you to take this implementation, fix the bugs and refactor it so it is easier to understand what is going on. 
 
There is no time limit on this task and you are free to use whatever IDE's, technologies or tools you feel appropriate.
